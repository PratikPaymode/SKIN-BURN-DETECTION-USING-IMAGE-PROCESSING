# Skin Burn Detection Using Image Processing

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting skin burn injuries using image processing techniques.  
The system analyzes images of burned skin and classifies them based on visual features to assist in preliminary burn assessment.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop an automated approach for identifying skin burn injuries using digital image processing, reducing dependency on manual inspection.

## Dataset
The project uses skin burn images for analysis and classification.
Images are preprocessed before feature extraction and classification.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Methodology
1. Image acquisition  
2. Image preprocessing (resizing, noise removal, enhancement)  
3. Feature extraction using image processing techniques  
4. Classification of burn images based on extracted features
